Pulse Share is a mobile application where blood donors can sign up and input their blood type, availability, and location (with additional information). Patients or their families request specific donations and are matched with donors. This app will decrease the pressure on blood banks and hospitals, while also centralizing a platform for blood donations currently scattered around different platforms.

You can see the application in action by downloading this [demo video](demo.mkv)
